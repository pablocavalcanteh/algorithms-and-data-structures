# Algorithms and data structures in Python.

## Data Structure

A data structure is an efficient way to store and organize data with associated operations
in order to take advantage as long as possible it.

## Algorithm

Algorithm can be defined as a simple and objective sequence of instructions to figure a certain problem out.
Each instruction is an information that indicates to the computer an basic action to being executed.

### List

In Computer Science, a list is a linear data structure used to store and organize data on a computer.
A structure of type list is a sequence of elements of the same type. Its elements have an abstracted internal structure,
that is, its complexity is arbitrary and doesn't affect its functioning. Besides that, a list can have repeated elements,
as well as it can be sorted or unordered, rely on the application.

### Queue

In computing, a queue is nothing more than a finite set of items (of the same type) waiting for a service or processing.
This' a very common flow control in computing. As can might imagine, a queue, as well as a list, is a sequence of elements, but
unlike lists, items of a queue obey an entry and exit order. An item can only be removed from the queue after all items
in front of it have also been removed.

### Stack

A stack is a finite set of items sub over the same topic, but unlike lists, the items of a stack are stacked on top of each other.
Thus, to access a certain element of the stack, all elements that are on top of it must be removed. For this reason, stacks are known as
last-in, first-out or LIFO structures: elements are popped from the stack in the reverse order of how they were inserted.

### Graph

A graph is a mathematical model that stands for the relationships between objects in a given set.

### Tree

A tree is a mathematical abstraction used to stand for non-linear hierarchical structures of modeled objects.
